# Wild Workshop - React

I created this repo to mirror [this one](https://github.com/LoicBrassart/wild-workshop-jsbasics).
The end result is the same (I copy-pasted the CSS from the other one, for instance), but we now use React.

## Installation

To use this demo, in your terminal:
- `git clone https://github.com/LoicBrassart/wild-workshop-react` to get the code on your machine
- `npm i` to install all modules in the `node_modules` folder (`i` stands for `install`)
- `npm start` to launch the demo itself

## Disclaimer

All pictures are from "Terra Battle" (a mobile game I played a few years ago) and I should probably have used free images instead... Sorry about that !
